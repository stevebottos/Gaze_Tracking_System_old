# Gaze_Tracking_System_old
A prototype version of an algorithm which will track a reader's progression through text. Please visit https://stevebottos.github.io/2018/08/13/Gaze-Tracking-System/ for a detailed write-up of the system.

The full description is available on my website, written with Jupyter notebooks. This repo provides you with everything you need (minus Python itself) to run the program.
